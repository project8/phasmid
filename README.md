## Development environment

### Gateware development
The FPGA gateware is developed in Matlab/Simulink on [this fork](https://github.com/sma-wideband/mlib_devel) (commit [a288ff3](https://github.com/sma-wideband/mlib_devel/commit/a288ff331e933f312ff1c73956b1096ce323a772)) of [mlib_devel](https://github.com/casper-astro/mlib_devel).

In addition it requires [acasperelle](https://github.com/anyoung/acasperelle/blob/master/README.md).
